Instant Cloud Based Telephony Applications with Twilio and Heroku


Using Services that did not exist 5 years ago, you can now build Interactive
Voice Response and interactive SMS applications easily and quickly.  Twilio
provides the hooks into the Phone and SMS networks and Heroku lets you run (and
scale) the back-end for little to no cost.

In this talk I'll discuss the business need that lead my company to create our
own IVR prototyping environment, the framework I craeated for rapid development
and deployment, and finally how the services and technology all fits together.

I'll provide you with and walk you through my framework for state machine based
IVR application development by creating, and deploying a new sms based
application during the talk.
