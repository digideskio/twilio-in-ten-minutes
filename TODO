* Configuration
  * Given the base URL from Twilio, if we ask the user for their Twilio account credentials
  * can we create the config/twilio.yml for them?
  * can we even set the app's url via a Twilio api? -- at least for the sandbox.
  * could provide rake tasks that allow easy integration w/Twilio's REST api, see:
       http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/account

* Workflow Testing
  * State Machine Correctness
    * Assert that there is a 'message' or a handler for each state 
    * show those warnings via rake & in the console

* SMS Example for example CCard / La Cosa Nostra 
  * on 'scare and hang up', send an SMS: "Speical Message From La Cosa Nostra: You will sleep with the fishes!"
  * on 'thank user and hang up', send an SMS: "Special Message From La Cosa Nostra: We've got your back Pisan!"
