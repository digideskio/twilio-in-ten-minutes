h1. Twilio In Ten Minutes

I must make many assumptions about you, the reader of this guide, in order to achieve the goal set by the title of this guide.  If you meet my assumptions then I hope that you'll be able to get your first applicaiton up and running in a very, very short time.

If you don't, don't worry.  I will provide more details about what you're doing further on in the guide.  So if you can't get your app deployed in 10 min, don't despair!  You're probalby still only a few steps away, look for more details further on in the guide.  Failing that, drop me ("Kyle Burton":mailto:kyle.burton@gmail.com) a line and I'll help you work through things.

Anxious to pick up your phone and call your application?  Then lets get 'er done!

h1. Deploing your First Application

We're going to make and deploy an application that you can call with your phone and it will greet you:

h3. 1. Sign up for Heroku

!(shadow)images/heroku-1-signup.png!

!(shadow)images/heroku-3-signup.png!

You should then be shown your 'applications page'.

h3. Grab The Source Code For This Guide

h3. Install the heroku gem

h3. Install the bundler gem

h3. Run @bundle install@

!images/terminal-run-bundle-install.png!

h3. Run @heroku create@

When prompted, enter the credentials you creatd when you signed up in the earlier step:

!images/terminal-run-heroku-create.png!

Note your application's url, this will be vital for when you sign up for Twilio.  For my example application, as seen in the screenshot above, it is @http://warm-wind-609.heroku.com/@

Heroku automatically added your application's git remote to your local git repository.

Push the application code to heroku:

  git push heroku master
