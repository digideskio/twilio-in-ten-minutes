h1. Twilio In Ten Minutes

I must make many assumptions about you, the reader of this guide, in order to achieve the goal set by the title of this guide.  If you meet my assumptions then I hope that you'll be able to get your first applicaiton up and running in a very, very short time.

If you don't, don't worry.  I will provide more details about what you're doing further on in the guide.  So if you can't get your app deployed in 10 min, don't despair!  You're probalby still only a few steps away, look for more details further on in the guide.  Failing that, drop me ("Kyle Burton":mailto:kyle.burton@gmail.com) a line and I'll help you work through things.

Anxious to pick up your phone and call your application?  Then lets get 'er done!
