h1. Awesome IVR!

Twilio IVR Development Framework

This project includes a few parts: a gem for generating "TWML":http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/ (Twilio's markup language); a modified "Newflow":https://github.com/trotter/newflow; and an IVR Workflow base class.

h1. Prerequisits

You have PostgreSQL installed and have administrative access.  

You have signed up for Twilio and Heroku (see "An Interactive Voice Response System in 10 Minutes":http://asymmetrical-view.com/2011/02/20/twilio-in-ten-minutes.html for a walk through of signing up for these services).

h1. Installation

The project was developed to be deployed to "Heroku":http://heroku.com/.  Because of this, it makes use of a postgres databse.  To initialize your databse, install PostgreSQL and perform the the following grants (also found in the pg-grants.psql file):

<code>
create role twilio with createdb login encrypted password 'tw9987$$5';

create database twilio_app_development with owner=twilio encoding='UTF8' template template0;
create database twilio_app_test        with owner=twilio encoding='UTF8' template template0;

grant all privileges on database twilio_app_development to twilio;
grant all privileges on database twilio_app_test        to twilio;
</code>


h3. Heroku

When you deploy to Heroku they will create a database and set the configuration for your dyno.

Once you've allocated your Heroku instance, not your application's hostname for when you configure Twilio.

h3. Twilio

In your dashboard, fill in the 'Voice URL' box with your Heroku applicaiton's URL followed by @/workflow/CCard@.  This will configure Twilio to use the sample credit card activaiton flow when you call your sandbox phone number.
